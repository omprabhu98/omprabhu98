### Welcome to Om Prabhu's Github Page

A little bit about myself: 
I am currently working on a Master's of Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley with a concentration in Control of Robotics and Autonomous Systems. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Rutgers University with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. My interests include robotics, electric vehicles, and aerospace and I am looking for full-time opportunities where I can use my technical skills to work on projects that will accelerate humanity into the future! When I am not working, I enjoy playing volleyball, doing crosswords, and participating in trivia contests.

This page contains a portfolio of some of my previous and current projects. I have added links and descriptions for each of them, but feel free to email me any further questions at omprabhu98@gmail.com
