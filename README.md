## Welcome to Om Prabhu's Github Page


**A little bit about myself:**


I am currently working on a Master's of Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley with a concentration in Control of Robotics and Autonomous Systems. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Rutgers University with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. My interests include robotics, electric vehicles, and aerospace and I am looking for full-time opportunities where I can use my technical skills to work on projects that will accelerate humanity into the future! When I am not working, I enjoy playing volleyball, doing crosswords, and participating in trivia contests.


This page contains a portfolio of some of my previous and current projects. I have added links and descriptions for each of them, but feel free to email me any further questions at omprabhu98@gmail.com


**In Progress**


Zendar Capstone Project: 
For my Master's program, I am currently working on a capstone project with Zendar, a manufacturer of high-definition radar to be utilized on autonomous vehicles. I am leading a team of 4 people to develop an algorithm that will run image segmentation on camera streams and then use this data to identify objects on a radar stream simultaneously. We are using OpenCV in Python and our current progress can be seen at: https://github.com/Mmengyw/Capstone-Project


**Completed**


Robotics Final Project- SawYeet: 
My team and I decided to make a Sawyer arm track and hit a ball for the final project for our Introduction to Robotics class. We encountered many difficulties, but overcame them through perseverance and creative problem solving using all available tools on ROS and OpenCV. Our final implementation uses color segmentation to track the ball, Kalman filters for the trajectory, and an internal hashmap for the joint trajectories. We made a website to showcase our results and how we got there at: https://sawyeet.github.io
